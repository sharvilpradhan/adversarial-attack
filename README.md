# Adversarial Attack on Sentiment Analysis Models

# Description

The motivation for this project was to examine and analyze the heavy data-driven approach of all sentiment analysis models. The corpus on which the word embeddings are trained may not have enough positive or negative connotations of certain words as a result of which the sentiment analysis models are not able to predict the sentiment with confidence.

## What I learnt?

- Text pre-processing (Lemmatization, POS Tagging, Noise removal, Tokenization, Removing stop words)
- Building Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model
- Object-oriented programming concepts and application
- Create Word embeddings
- Sentiment analysis
- Python dictonary
